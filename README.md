# Udacity_ComputerVision_Nanodegree
This repository consists of three projects I implemented as part of Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree Program
The projects are applications of Computer Vision and Deep Learning concepts. 



## Facial Keypoint Detection
In this project, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented for detecting 68 crucial features or points in a face such as eyes, nose, corners of the mouth etc.


## Image Captioning
In this project, a neural network is implemented. THe network is a combination of a CNN and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The network is trained to provide captions (descriptive texts) for any given imput image.


## Landmark Detection and Tracking SLAM
This project implements SLAM - Simulateneous Localization and Mapping in a 2D world. It utilizes the principles of Kalman-Filter and graph-SLAM.
